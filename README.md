dotfiles - Public personal repository for my dot files
======================================================

dotfiles as they are known are small files that live within a users home
folder (generally) and contain useful information, such as a .vimrc containing
various commands that customise vim to a certain users liking. These dotfiles
are generally shared between machines using various mechanism such as `scp` or
over http.

These days with github and bitbucket it has become easier to put up a public
repository of ones dotfiles, and it has become surprisingly common place to do
so.

I being late to the party am getting these files online mainly so I can easily
keep them updated between machines where Dropbox does not have clients. You
are free to peruse what I have in my dotfiles, even suggest changes if you
have any good ones.

There is not a whole lot in this repository at the moment, I hope to expand it
soon when I get a chance to go through all of my dotfiles and see which ones I
can easily place here.
